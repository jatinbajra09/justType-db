                <h3 class="tutorial-title">What can you do to Speed up your Typing?</h3>
                <p>Increasing your typing speed depends on a couple of factors, such as:<br><br><u class="difftext">Keyboard Type:</u> The type of keyboard you use greatly impacts how you type. Two common types of keyboards are mechanical and membrane. There is no perfect keyboard, and which type you end up liking depends entirely on you. So, it is generally recommended that you try typing in both types of keyboards in a store before you buy one.<br><br><u class="difftext">Keyboard Positioning:</u> You use the keyboard either in a flat position or in a diagonal position. While it is a personal choice, most people recommend that you start typing at a slanted height, which is said to increase typing speed.<br><br><u class="difftext">Proper Posture:</u> Sitting straight on a chair will give you proper posture, which will help you in the long run. With proper posture, your hands will be able to easily reach all the keys on the keyboard without wasting too much effort.<br><br><u class="difftext">Finger Placement:</u> Finger placement is very important, and a correct finger placement will encourage muscle memory. Your left-hand fingers should be positioned above the A, S, D, and F keys, while your right-hand finger should be above the H, J, K, and L keys.</p>

            <div class="tutorial" id="fivesteps">
                <h3 class="tutorial-title">Increase your Typing Speed with these 5 steps</h3>
                <p><u class="difftext">Step 1 - Practice makes Perfect:</u> Practice is essential for everything, and the same goes for typing club. The more you type, the better you will get in the long run. Try writing slow initially. As you begin to write, your hands will automatically get used to positioning all the letter keys. As you keep writing, your speed will slowly increase.<br><br><u class="difftext">Step 2 - Be in a Comfortable Position:</u> Comfort matters a lot. Sit in an uncomfortable position or in the wrong posture. You will have trouble reaching every key on every corner of the keyboard. As you put more effort into reaching all the corners, you will begin to feel muscle fatigue.<br><br><u class="difftext">Step 3 - Try Not to Look at the Keyboard all the Time:</u> Initially, you must look at the keyboard to type accurately and continuously. Still, as you practice more, you will begin to form muscle memory. This muscle memory will help you type faster and more easily. So, try not to look at the keyboard all the time. Typing while looking at the screen rather than the keyboard will allow you to write even faster. You will no longer waste time looking at the screen, reading the words and then looking back at the keyboard to write it down.<br><br><u class="difftext">Step 4 - Use our Type Test:</u> Our typing test brings out meaningful and variety of passages for you to practice on. Each test will have a different passage, but the passages may be repeated, just like how it will be in real-life situations.<br><br><u class="difftext">Step 5 - Keep making Improvements:</u> As you keep practising, try making improvements each day. Improvements such as being more precise and accurate should be part of your writing habits. Give yourself a challenge that you will try to complete the following passage in 15 seconds.</p>

                <h3 class="about-title">What is a Typing Test?</h3>
                <p>A typing test is a practical test used to measure a person's typing speed and accuracy. A typing test usually involves a passage you must type in a given time limit. This test will determine how many words you can type per minute, also called WPM. It will also calculate if you have made any errors while typing; the final result will depend on these factors.</p>
